travis-docker-example
=====================

Proof of concept for running docker in a Travis CI build under [User Mode Linux](http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net)

With inspiration from:

* [Docker unit tests](https://github.com/jpetazzo/docker/blob/master/.travis.yml)
* [travis-vagrant-up](https://github.com/veewee-community/travis-vagrant-up) (no longer working) and its accompanying [blog post](http://keyholesoftware.com/2012/12/05/building_vagrant_boxes_with_veewee_on_travis/)
